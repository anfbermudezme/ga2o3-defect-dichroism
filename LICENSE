RESEARCH VALIDATION NOTICE (Non-Binding Technical Statement)

1. Physical Validation Scope

   This software implements structured parsing and validation routines
   tailored to CRYSTAL23 electronic-structure calculations of β-Ga₂O₃
   and related defect systems.

   Validation logic may include, but is not limited to:

   - Detection of spin polarization and exchange splitting
   - Identification of dispersionless in-gap states
   - Band alignment and VBM referencing
   - Polarization-resolved dielectric tensor consistency
   - Finite-size supercell comparison checks
   - Numerical integrity verification of parsed datasets

2. Scientific Responsibility

   While the software performs automated physical consistency checks,
   it does not replace expert interpretation of first-principles results.
   The final scientific conclusions derived from the outputs remain the
   responsibility of the user.

3. Reproducibility Statement

   The repository is designed to promote computational reproducibility
   by preserving:

   - Original CRYSTAL23 inputs
   - Raw output logs
   - Deterministic post-processing routines
   - Test-covered parsing pipelines

   Users are encouraged to retain computational provenance when modifying
   or redistributing derivative works.

4. Third-Party Engines

   Electronic-structure calculations are performed by external engines
   (e.g., CRYSTAL23, CASTEP). This software validates and post-processes
   their outputs but does not modify their internal numerical solvers.
